# Refactoring Changelog

This file tracks the changes made during the refactoring process based on `refactoring_guide.md`.

## Phase 1: Critical System Components

### 2025-08-04

*   **Refactored `scripts/setup/reset_database.sql`:**
    *   Translated all table names to English (e.g., `procurement_requests` -> `procurements`).
    *   Translated all column names to English (e.g., `navn` -> `name`), except for user-facing content fields (`description`, `reasoning`, `color`).
    *   Translated all function names to English (e.g., `opprett_anskaffelse` -> `create_procurement`).
    *   Updated function parameters to use `camelCase` for JSON consistency (e.g., `request_id` -> `procurementId`).
    *   Updated `gateway_service_catalog` and `gateway_acl_config` to reflect the new function names.

## Phase 2: Python Codebase

### 2025-08-04

*   **Refactored `src/models/procurement_models.py`:**
    *   Renamed `AnskaffelseRequest` to `ProcurementRequest` and translated its fields to English (`navn` -> `name`, etc.).
    *   Renamed `TriageResult` fields to English (`farge` -> `color`, etc.).
    *   Introduced a `TriageColor` Enum to enforce type safety for triage colors, while keeping the Norwegian values ("GRØNN", "GUL", "RØD").
    *   Renamed `ProtocolResult.protocol_text` to `ProtocolResult.content`.

*   **Refactored `src/specialists/triage_agent.py`:**
    *   Renamed method `vurder_anskaffelse` to `assess_procurement`.
    *   Updated the agent to use the new `ProcurementRequest` and `TriageResult` models with English field names.
    *   Modified the system prompt to request JSON with English keys (`color`, `reasoning`).

*   **Refactored `src/specialists/protocol_generator.py`:**
    *   Updated the agent to use the new `ProcurementRequest` and `ProtocolResult` models with English field names.
    *   Updated user-facing prompt to use English labels (e.g., "Tittel" -> "Title").

*   **Refactored `src/orchestrators/reasoning_orchestrator.py`:**
    *   Updated imports to use the new Pydantic models (`ProcurementRequest`, `TriageResult`).
    *   Modified `_call_specialist_agent` to call the refactored `assess_procurement` method on `TriageAgent`.
    *   Updated method calls and parameter names throughout the orchestrator to align with the new English-based, camelCase standard (e.g., `database.create_procurement`, `procurementId`).
    *   **Refactored `gateway/main.py`:**
    *   Updated the `ResponseValidator` to use the new English method and field names.
    *   Updated the default fallback configurations in `get_default_service_catalog` and `load_acl_config` to use the new English names.
    *   Ensured all other functionality (`/metrics`, `/health`, etc.) was preserved during the refactoring.

*   **Refactored `src/tools/rpc_gateway_client.py`:**
    *   Removed old, Norwegian-named convenience methods (`lagre_triage_resultat`, `sett_status`, etc.).
    *   Added new, English-named convenience methods (`save_triage_result`, `set_procurement_status`, etc.) that align with the refactored RPC functions and Pydantic models.
    *   **Corrected SQL Syntax in `reset_database.sql`:**
    *   Fixed inconsistent `CREATE FUNCTION` syntax by ensuring all function bodies are correctly wrapped in `$`.
    *   Corrected the `INSERT` statements for `gateway_service_catalog` to use explicit `::jsonb` casting, ensuring valid JSONB data is inserted.

*   **Refactored `main.py` (formerly `src/main.py`):**
    *   Moved the file to the project root to act as a main entry point.
    *   Added logic to append the project root to `sys.path` to ensure correct module resolution.
    *   Updated the script to use the refactored `ProcurementRequest` model.
    *   Modified the test case and assertions to align with the new English-based method names and data structures (e.g., asserting `database.create_procurement` was called).
